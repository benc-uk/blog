My name is Ben Coleman, and I'm an application developer and all round technology geek. 

Iâ€™ve worked in IT for over 20 years in a wide number of roles and technical domains from mainframes to cloud and DevOps. I am currently employed at Microsoft as a Cloud Solution Architect where I help Microsoft partners build & develop solutions on Azure.  

This blog is mainly focused on various app development topics that include cloud, containers, open-source, DevOps, web apps, CI/CD, etc.  

I live in London with my wife and cats, I spend my time running, making electronic music, gaming and of course; programming
