title: Azure Resource Manager - Tech Primer
tags: [azure, devops, infrastructure-as-code, automation, guide]

First in a series of "tech primers" on a range of topics. Created for a technical audience, that might be new to a particular topic or domain. I wanted to solve several things with these primers, combining both introductory overview content, but also technical reference material and deeper dives into various key areas.

If youâ€™re new to Azure and especially the Azure Resource Manager, this guide is a handy place to get started

This content can be used for presentations, used in labs & exercises but also given as handout/reading material.
